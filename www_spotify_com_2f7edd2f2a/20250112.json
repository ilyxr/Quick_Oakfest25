As such, we will be unable to verify and honor your requests.\nHousehold requests\nIf all the members of a household make an access, correction or deletion request, we will respond as if the requests are individual requests.\nRequests made through agents\nYou may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney (in accordance with local law), an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights.

This applies where the content provider inserts advertising into the podcast to fund it. The hosting provider, which might not be Spotify, manages these controls for the podcast.\nYou can also visit our services via a browser with a recognized opt-out preference signal enabled, such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC). If you use a preference signal you may need to renew your preferences if you visit the Spotify Service with another device or browser, or if you clear your cookies.\nIf you are \u2018opted out\u2019 of tailored advertising on your\nAccount Privacy\npage, you will receive less relevant advertising, including on our free Service Option, as well as our paid Service Option, as applicable (for example, advertising in podcasts).

When you reach the appropriate age, you will start to receive tailored advertising . When this happens, you will receive a message within the Spotify Service to let you know.
